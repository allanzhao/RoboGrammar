## 1.0.0

Released 2015-03-29

Version 1.0.0 was a very large refactoring based on the previous years of experience.
The core design and approach were kept, but nearly all details of the implementation were changed, and some parts were added to, or removed from, the library.
Semantic versioning was introduced with version 1.0.0.

* Deprecated old site on Google code and published new version on GitHub.
* Removed the semi-automatic pretty-printing of grammar rules; now the class names are used, when possible demangled.
* Renamed rule classes with multiple words in their names to use underscores, e.g. `ifmust<>` is now `if_must<>`.
* Removed support for incremental/stream parsing to allow for some simplifications and optimisations (*reintroduced in 2.0.0*).
* Removed the rules `apply<>` and `if_apply<>` that were used to directly call actions from within the grammar (*reintroduced in 2.0.0*), and:
* Where the other method of attaching actions to rules in PEGTL 0.x required specialisation of a given class template `action<>`, in PEGTL 1.y the action class template can be chosen by the user and changed at any point in the grammar.
* As a side-effect there is a much cleaner way of enabling and disabling actions in a portion of the grammar.
* Actions now have access to the current position in the input, i.e. to the filename, and line and column number.
* Actions now receive a pointer to, and the size of, the matched portion of the input (previously a `std::string` with a copy of the matched data), therefore:
* ~~There is no distinction between actions that require access to the matched data and those that don't, furthermore~~:
* The object via which actions gain access to the matched data is similar to that which rules receive ~~so actions can easily invoke another grammar on the matched data.~~
* The `at<>` and `not_at<>` rules now call their subordinate rules with actions disabled.
* The variadic `states...` arguments that are passed through all rule invocations for use by the actions are *not* forwarded with `std::forward<>` anymore since it (usually) doesn't make much sense to move them, and accidentially moving multiple times was a possible error scenario.
* There are now five different `rep` rules for repeating a sequence of rules with more control over the acceptable or required number of repetitions.
* There are new rules `try_catch<>` and `try_catch_type<>` that convert global errors, i.e. exceptions, into local errors, i.e. a return value of `false`.
* Unified concept for actions and debug hooks, i.e. just like the actions are called from a class template that is passed into the top-level `parse()` function, there is another class template that is called for debug/trace and error throwing purposes; both can be changed at any point within the grammar.
* A large under-the-hood reorganisation has the benefit of preventing actions from being invoked on rules that are implementation details of other rules, e.g. the `pad< Rule, Padding >` rule contains `star< Padding >` in its implementation, so a specialisation of the action-class-template for `star< Padding >` would be called within `pad<>`, even though the `star< Pad >` was not explicitly written by the user; in PEGTL 1.y these unintended action invocations no longer occur.
* Partial support for Unicode has been added in the form of some basic rules like `one<>` and `range<>` also being supplied in a UTF-8 (and experimental UTF-16 and UTF-32) aware version(s) that can correctly process arbitrary code points from `0` to `0x10ffff`.
* The supplied input classes work together with the supplied exception throwing to support better error locations when performing nested file parsing, i.e. a `parse_error` contains a vector of parse positions.
* Added a function to analyse a grammar for the presence of infinite loops, i.e. cycles in the rules that do not (necessarily) consume any input like left recursion.
* As actions are applied to a grammar in a non-invasive way, several common grammars were added to the PEGTL as documented in [Contrib and Examples](Contrib-and-Examples.md).
* The `list<>`-rule was replaced by a set of new list rules with different padding semantics.
* The `at_one<>` and other rules `foo` that are merely shortcuts for `at< foo >` were removed.
* The `if_then<>` rule was removed.
* The `error_mode` flag was removed.
* The semantics of the `must<>` rules was changed to convert local failure to global failure only for the immediate sub-rules of a `must<>` rule.
* The `parse()` functions now return a `bool` and can also produce local failures. To obtain the previous behaviour of success-or-global-failure, the top-level grammar rule has to be wrapped in a `must<>`.

* Changed class `basic_debug` to only generate a grammar back-trace when a `pegtl::parse_error` is flying.
* Changed logging to use a virtual member function on the debug class inherited from common debug base class.
* Removed all `*_parse_*_nothrow()` parse functions.
* Removed the `_throws` substring from all remaining parse functions and changed the return type to `void`.
* Added convenience classes `file_input`, `ascii_file_input` and `dummy_file_input` for custom parse functions.

## 0.26

* Changed pretty-printing of the `until` and `if...` rules (consistency).
* Changed pretty-printing of rules to use ":=" instead of "===" (conciseness).

* Renamed action `apply_nth` to `nth`, and renamed some other actions (consistency).
* Extended pretty-printing to the `apply` and `ifapply` rules (completeness).

The last of these changes effectively requires custom action classes to derive either from a valid rule class, or from the new class `pegtl::action_helper<>`, passing itself as template argument.

* Removed the redundant rules `space_star`, `space_plus`, `blank_star`, and `blank_plus` (minimalism).
* Added new rule class `list` (not to be confused with the old, very different, rule `list`) (convenience).
* Changed class `seq` to invoke the `marker` with a modified `Must` flag for single-rule sequences (performance).
* Changed rule class `until1` to be a specialisation of `until`, rather than have a different name (consistency).
* Changed around the order of the template arguments of the `until` rule (consistency and flexibility).
* Changed around the order of the template arguments of the `rep` rule and reduced to strict repeat (minimalism).
* Changed many rule classes from one template argument to variadic sequence of arguments (flexibility).

Development of the PEGTL started in November 2007 as an experiment in C++0x.
It is based on ideas from the YARD library by Christopher Diggins.
